# San d'Wich

## A super quick modular Facebook chatbot using unofficial APIs

To run, clone and do `npm install` and then `node sandwich.js`. Sandwich will
load all of the middleware in `/modules` and all the commands from `/commands`.
I'll do a more comprehensive writeup later, maybe.

You also need `mongod` running. Check `/bot/config.js` for the config details.
